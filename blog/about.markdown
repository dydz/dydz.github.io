I'm Daniel Bates.

I started using a computer around the age of 5 to play games, but was more excited at the thought of writing my own and sharing it with others. I took an unconventional journey to learn how to do this through the world of desktop publishing and automation. Then I went on a long tangent through the web stack. This included sys admining my own colocated 1U servers running <a href="https://www.freebsd.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FreeBSD</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/server/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mac OS X Server</a>, finding <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1772690.1772701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XSS</a> vulnerabilities in web pages and working on a <a href="https://www.webkit.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">browser engine</a>. I use to work on <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iOS</a>. Now I work on <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>.

It was fascinating to me when I was young to watch the computer do things faster and more precisely than I ever could. It still fascinates me now.
